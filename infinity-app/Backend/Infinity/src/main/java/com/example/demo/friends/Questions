my implementation of friends will look something like this
First_Userid | Second_Userid
        1   |   2
        2   |   5
        2   |   4
        1   |   5
1) If any, what is this kind of relationship
2) If I were to implement this how would I get the ID of the
User sending the request...ex Friendship(1,2) {1 and 2 are friends, but 1
sent the request} and the controller would look something like this
/user/{THIS USER} 1/addfriend/ {OTHER USER}2
how do I get the  Id of this user?
